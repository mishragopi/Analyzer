        st.write('''<p>Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) is a Competitive network which uses supervised learning. It applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. Learning vector quantization (LVQ) is a family of algorithms for statistical pattern classification, which aims at learning prototypes (codebook vectors) representing class regions. 
        The class regions are defined by hyperplanes between prototypes, yielding Voronoi partitions. In the late 1980s, TeuvoKohonen introduced the algorithm LVQ1 and over the years produced several variants. 
        Since their inception, LVQ algorithms have been researched by a small but active community. A search on the ISI Web of Science in November, 2013, found 665 journal articles with the keywords ‘‘learning vector quantization’’ or ‘‘LVQ’’ in their titles or abstracts.</p>
        <p>LVQ algorithms are related to other competitive learning algorithms such as self-organizing maps (SOMs) and c-means. Competitive learning algorithms are based on the winner-take-all learning rule and variants in which only certain elements or neighborhoods are updated during learning. 
        The original LVQ algorithms and most modern extensions use supervised learning for obtaining classlabeled prototypes (classifiers). However, LVQ can also be trained without labels by unsupervised learning for clustering purposes. 
        </p><p>LVQ classifiers are particularly intuitive and simple to understand because they are based on the notion of class representatives (prototypes) and class regions usually in the input space (Voronoi partitions). 
        This is an advantage over multilayer perceptrons or support vector machines (SVMs), which are considered to be black boxes. 
        Moreover, support vectors are extreme values (those having minimum margins) of the datasets, while LVQ prototypes are typical vectors. Another advantage of LVQ algorithms is that they are simple and fast, as a result of being based on Hebbian learning. 
        The computational cost of LVQ algorithms depends on the number of prototypes, which are usually a fixed number. 
        SVMs depend on the number of training samples instead, because the number of support vectors is a fraction of the size of the training set. LVQ has been shown to be a valuable alternative to SVMs.</p>''',
